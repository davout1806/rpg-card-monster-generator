Slam: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution save or become diseased with huecuva blight. While diseased, the creature is poisoned, and after completing a long rest, its maximum hit points are reduced by 7 (2d6). After each complete long rest, the target repeats the saving throw, ending the disease on a success. If the disease ends, the target's maximum hit points return to their normal maximum immediately.	Command Undead: Each turned undead that the huecuva can see within 50 ft. may immediately make a saving throw against the turning's DC to end the turning effect. An undead creature that makes its save can use its reaction to move its speed, ending closer to the huecuva or the huecuva's enemies.
